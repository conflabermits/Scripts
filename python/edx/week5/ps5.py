For this problem, the graders will use our implementation of the Message class, so don't worry if you did not get the previous parts correct.

PlaintextMessage is a subclass of Message and has methods to encode a string using a specified shift value.
Our class will always create an encoded version of the message, and will have methods for changing the encoding.

Implement the methods in the class PlaintextMessage according to the specifications in ps6.py. The methods you should fill in are:

* __init__(self, text, shift): Use the parent class constructor to make your code more concise.
* The getter method get_shift(self)
* The getter method get_encrypting_dict(self): This should return a COPY of self.encrypting_dict to prevent someone from mutating the original dictionary.
* The getter method get_message_text_encrypted(self)
* change_shift(self, shift): Think about what other methods you can use to make this easier. It shouldn’t take more than a couple lines of code.

For this problem, the graders will use our implementation of the Message and PlaintextMessage classes, so don't worry if you did not get the previous parts correct.

Given an encrypted message, if you know the shift used to encode the message, decoding it is trivial. If message is the encrypted message,
and s is the shift used to encrypt the message, then apply_shift(26-s) on a message gives you the original plaintext message. Do you see why?

The problem, of course, is that you don’t know the shift. But our encryption method only has 26 distinct possible values for the shift!
We know English is the main language of these emails, so if we can write a program that tries each shift and maximizes the number of
English words in the decoded message, we can decrypt their cipher! A simple indication of whether or not the correct shift has been found is
if most of the words obtained after a shift are valid words. Note that this only means that most of the words obtained are actual words.
It is possible to have a message that can be decoded by two separate shifts into different sets of words. While there are various
strategies for deciding between ambiguous decryptions, for this problem we are only looking for a simple solution.

Fill in the methods in the class CiphertextMessage acording to the specifications in ps6.py. The methods you should fill in are:

* __init__(self, text): Use the parent class constructor to make your code more concise.
* decrypt_message(self): You may find the helper function is_word(wordlist, word) and the string method split() useful.
  Note that is_word will ignore punctuation and other special characters when considering whether a word is valid.

You may find the function string.split useful for dividing the text up into words.

>>> 'Hello world!'.split('o')
['Hell', ' w', 'rld!']
>>> '6.00.1x is pretty fun'.split(' ')
['6.00.1x', 'is', 'pretty', 'fun']

Problem 4 - Decrypt a Story

For this problem, the graders will use our implementation of the Message, PlaintextMessage, and CiphertextMessage classes,
so don't worry ifyou did not get the previous parts correct.

Now that you have all the pieces to the puzzle, please use them to decode the file story.txt.
The file ps6.py contains a helper function get_story_string() that returns the encrypted version of the story as a string.
Create a CiphertextMessage object using the story string and use decrypt_message to return the appropriate shift value and unencrypted story string.
