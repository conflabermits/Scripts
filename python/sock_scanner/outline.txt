# I've been given a request from someone to set up a script that looks at a website,
# determines if socks are available for sale, and sends a notification if they are.
# Additional requirements haven't been determined yet, but I imagine I'll need:
# - The website address
# - The page(s) to search for socks on the website
# - The email address to send notifications to
# - The check interval (daily?)
# - Any specific details I should use to filter wanted from unwanted results
