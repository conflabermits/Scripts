# Trusty Web Server

This is a simple web server with a simple goal: to respond with a consistent set of responses (HTTP response code, content, and/or actions) based on the endpoint requested.

It can be used for testing programs that make requests to a web server. The value is that the responses are consistent and predictable, which allows you to validate the functionality of the program making the requests instead of second-guessing if the remote endpoint is responding reliably.

## Requests and Expected Responses

| Request | HTTP Response Code | Response Content | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [/ok](http://localhost:8080/ok) | 200 | Health check response: "OK" |  |
| [/degraded](http://localhost:8080/degraded) | 200 | Health check response: "Degraded" |  |
| [/outage](http://localhost:8080/outage) | 200 | Health check response: "Outage" |  |
| [/200](http://localhost:8080/200) | 200 | (Blank page) |  |
| [/301](http://localhost:8080/301) | 301 | | Redirect to "/200" |
| [/302](http://localhost:8080/302) | 302 | | Redirect to "/ok" |
| [/401](http://localhost:8080/401) | 401 | "Not authorized" |  |
| [/404](http://localhost:8080/404) | 404 | "Page not found" |  |
| [/500](http://localhost:8080/500) | 500 | "Internal server error" |  |
| [/headers](http://localhost:8080/headers) | 200 | Client headers |  |

## Running the server

The web server can be run as-is using `go run`:

```text
go run trusty_web_server.go
```

It can also be compiled into a binary for easier portability:

```text
go build trusty_web_server.go
```

In either case it will run on port 8080 by default.

It takes `--port` as an optional argument, allowing you to specify which port the web server should be served on:

```text
go run trusty_web_server.go --port 38080
```
