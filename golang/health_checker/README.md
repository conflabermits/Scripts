# Health Checker

It checks health!

## What is `health_checker`?

The `health_checker` tool's main goal is to make HTTP requests to web applications, bring back the response, parse it, and pretty-print it.

The web applications are expected to respond with JSON content, and `health_checker` is capable of parsing the response JSON and displaying it in pretty-printed JSON of various lengths (dicted by its `depth` option).

It also has a web server mode where it can start up a simple HTTP server that will host a simple health checker HTML page. The page has a text box to enter the URL and a button that will perform the check and return the response to the page.
