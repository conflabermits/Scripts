# Pilot Stream 009 Notes

The one with an actual, specific end-goal!

## Summary

I want to take [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4APcFEwscoVfmwJelij53o?si=x9H5UlGuREKa6z3ZjOhL2w) and generate a list of the artists and the number of times they appear, in decending order.

## Details

This will build off of the work I did in my [previous stream](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/blob/main/stream/pilot/008/notes.md) where I started playing around with a third-party Go library that would allow me to talk to the Spotify API and display some data. [The work I've done so far](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/tree/main/golang/spotify_api_tester) has been very simple, mostly just copying, pasting, and slightly modifying some example code to understand what it's doing and how it's working.

I'll need to explore the API/library further to understand how to pull the data I want and manupulate it to sort and output the way I want.
