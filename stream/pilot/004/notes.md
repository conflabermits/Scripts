# Stream 004 Summary

Aiming to play around with Python enough to create a "Wordle Helper" that can assist with the generation of possible words based on current available knowledge. Not quite a "Wordle Solver", but something that would be an incremental step in that direction.

# Project Location

The files should all be in the [python/wordle](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/tree/main/python/wordle) part of this Scripts repo, unless I decide to do this in Go instead. üòÅ
