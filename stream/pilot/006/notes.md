# Pilot Stream 006 Notes

Wow, six public Twitch streams already? I wonder when this stops being a pilot...

## Summary

Goals for today's stream:

* Finish the python wordle helper
* Maybe add some testing for the wordle helper
* Mess around with whatever else, doesn't matter, let's go touch some code things!

## Python Wordle Helper

I started building a wordle helper in python [here](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/tree/master/python/wordle). I have some work remaining to finish it like implementing some testing to ensure I don't introduce new bugs (again) and making the entry of info easier.

## Future Streams

I'm still working out what else I'd want to do on stream. Right now I'm just enjoying streaming myself coding because I'm getting some personal projects done and learning some new things, and I guess most of my ideas are centered around that. It'd be nice to do something that would help others learn some things, maybe more intentionally than the passive effect of viewers watching me learn things, so I'll keep seeking out those ideas from others.

* Finish the golang [health_checker](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/tree/master/golang/health_checker)
  * Finish feature implementation
  * Incorporate web server element
  * Figure out if there's a better way to build it all without literally making it a single giant Go file
* Take a stab at creating a Wordle Helper in Go and building it into a standalone webapp thing
* Mess around with Docker (no clear ideas yet)
* Mess around with WSL templating or provisioning, maybe with the goal of establishing a ready-to-go DevOps/development platform that has a bunch of tools and programs preinstalled like Git, Terraform, kubectl, python3, golang, aws cli, etc.
* Learn and implement some Go testing best practices and add it to the [health_checker](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/tree/master/golang/health_checker) program/project
