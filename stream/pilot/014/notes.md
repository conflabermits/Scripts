# Pilot Stream 014 Notes

## Summary

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) -- How helpful are they?

## Details

I am not an experienced programmer. What I do for work is typically closer to scripting than coding. But that doesn't mean I don't want to learn, or that I don't want to create useful programs now.

GitHub Copilot sounds like it's a useful tool for speeding up code generation and solving potential problems with AI-generated suggestions. There's definitely some controversy around its use and whether or not the code it suggests is safe to use from a licensing standpoint. My goal will be to create something in a language that's still relatively new to me (Go), and to avoid doing anything that is blatently wrong (mainly by using its built-in [duplication detection](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)).

ChatGPT is being praised, albeit mildly, for a similar benefit. While it seems to confidently get some things wrong, it has an uncanny ability to generate code from simple word prompts. Hypothetically it could work in tandem with GitHub Copilot -- ChatGPT generating the first draft of code from a given prompt, and GitHub Copilot scanning it to look for mistakes and improvements.

While both may have benefits and advantages for anyone looking to learn how to code or become a better coder, they both sound like they may have their fair share of drawbacks and risks. In playing around with them, I'll have to look out for pitfalls and hassles.

I haven't come up with a good idea yet for the challenge, but as soon as I do I'll update here and figure out when to stream it.

## Potential Ideas

* Patreon comment sorter
* Wordle Helper reboot
* Countdown solver
* Pokemon lister
* JSON prettifier webpage
* Database webservice
