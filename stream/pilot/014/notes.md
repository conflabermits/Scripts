# Pilot Stream 014 Notes

## Summary

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) -- How helpful is it?

## Details

I am not an experienced programmer. What I do for work is typically closer to scripting than coding. But that doesn't mean I don't want to learn, or that I don't want to create useful programs now.

GitHub Copilot sounds like it's a useful tool for speeding up code generation and solving potential problems with AI-generated suggestions. There's definitely some controversy around its use and whether or not the code it suggests is safe to use from a licensing standpoint. My goal will be to create something in a language that's still relatively new to me (Go), and to avoid doing anything that is blatently wrong (mainly by using its built-in [duplication detection](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)).

I haven't come up with a good idea yet for the challenge, but as soon as I do I'll update here and figure out when to stream it.
