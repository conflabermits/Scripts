# Summary

Goals for today's stream:

* Finish the python wordle helper
* Improve the stream

# Python Wordle Helper

I started building a wordle helper in python [here](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/tree/master/python/wordle). I have some work remaining to finish it like implementing the logic for yellows and for duplicate latters.

# Improve The Stream

I noticed in a recording of the previous stream that the audio levels seemed really low, but I think I fixed that. I still want to figure out how to tweak the audio settings to allow background music to play while I stream but to prevent it from being saved in the stream recording or posted to Twitch. I also need to figure out how to either upload recorded videos to Twitch or to allow Twitch to save the stream recording.
