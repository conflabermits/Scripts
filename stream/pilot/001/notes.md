Just a simple markdown page to keep some notes for the stream. Definitely not because I'm notorious for going off script and forgetting what I was supposed to say. Not at all.

# Recommended Resources

These are some helpful resources, most that I've personally used, that I would recommend to others interested in playing around in this space.

* [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7) from EdX/MITx - Summer 2022 session: June 1 to August 3
* [Python 3 Cheat Sheet](https://perso.limsi.fr/pointal/_media/python:cours:mementopython3-english.pdf) - Two pages of at-a-glance Python 3 references and examples
* [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) - Quick resource for Go-lang reference examples
* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - A good book for getting started with Python 3 and coding in general
* *Any search engine* - Seriously, when you have a question or want to see how others have solved something, try a few different searches online! There's a good chance one or multiple people have solved the same or similar problems that you're facing, and that it's documented on StackOverflow, an instructional blog, or Reddit.
