# Pilot Stream 012 Notes

## Summary

Another visit to the [health_checker](https://github.com/conflabermits/health_checker) project to try to make it release-ready! It's so close!

## Details

In the last stream I fixed some issues that were preventing health_checker from working, including a mix-up of the mod.go files and their content. (Ugh!)

This stream I'm looking to close a couple other gaps and prepare the application for a v1.0.0 release:

* Embed the index.html file into the binary for easier distribution as a single-file web server program. ✅
* Investigate alternate ways to build the program(s), including separate binaries and utilizing a Makefile or script. ✅
* Test, update documentation, push, and cut a final release version of the program! (Might do this with [trusty_web_server](https://github.com/conflabermits/trusty_web_server) too.) ✅
