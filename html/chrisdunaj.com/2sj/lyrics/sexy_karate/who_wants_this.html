          Hey big J<br>
          Did you read the headlines today<br>
          Some are sayin that it's very odd<br>
          People killing for the love of god <br>
          Stop drop roll listen<br>
          If you missed the gist son kid here's what you're missin<br>
          Like it or not what's getting lost<br>
          Is the truth like laugh lines hit with <a href="javascript:popup(' (A drug that relaxes muscles, often used to make wrinkles on the face less prominent. Some argue, however, that it leaves people expressionless.)',0);" class="pn-text">Botox</a><br>
          The rich get tax cuts and pardons<br>
          The poor stay poor and keep starvin<br>
          Isn't it alarming that we're arming enemies while we just look on<br>
          The people need the light right now so here's the book on</p>
        <p>CEO's PO's and other liars<br>
          Holy shit Ranger <a href="javascript:popup('(In the summer of 2002 2 separate western wildfires were purposefully started by U.S. Forest Dept. employees.) ',1)" class="pn-text">Rick</a> 
          is Starting fires<br>
          It keeps coming and coming and coming like Michael Meyers<br>
          And you can hear my latest gem now on FBI wires<br>
          So if you're feeling this stick your fists up<br>
          Get your gets up, ladies arch your backs and point your tits up<br>
          If you're mixed up listen up here's the score<br>
          Say it straight, fuck the metaphors!</p>
        <p>Chorus<br>
          Who Wants This? (4x's)<br>
          It's time to kill the dark turn you're lights on<br>
          If you're feeling like I'm feeling sing my fight song<br>
          Or we'll see what it's like with our rights gone</p>
        <p>Now who wants the same shit from Monday to Sunday<br>
          Some may, but some way, it's gonna stop some day<br>
          Through my window sometimes I see visions<br>
          Of battalions and civilians and can't tell who are the villains<br>
          What's the difference - we're all in this when shit's hittin'<br>
          We all got courtside seats to Armageddon<br>
          We all gotta walk if the engine stops<br>
          We're all gonna fall when the bubble pops<br>
          CPA's, VP's, VIP's, NYPD<br>
          Supreme court justices to peanut galleries<br>
          Presidents descended from family dynasties<br>
          To the homeless resting on cardboard in the streets<br>
          Cuz you can get robbed blind by Wall street banking<br>
          Worse than at St. Mark's and Franklin<br>
          Thanks to stickup kids in ties and white collars<br>
          Who worship the almighty dollar, so holl</p>
        <p>CHORUS<br>
          Who Wants This? (4x's)<br>
          When the fix is in before you run the race<br>
          Is it too late for a change of pace?<br>
          The destruction, the corruption</p>
