          We don't need your cash or those options of stock<br>
          Shiny diamond rings or 8 cyls on the block<br>
          We don't give a damn if you have or you not<br>
          Cause who we represent?<br>
          People's Movement of Rock</p>
        <p>Do you indeed exceed the seed of needed moxy to mock me<br>
          On your house I put a pox <br>
          See, I take aim with freight trains as my proxy <br>
          You wanna battle?<br>
          Are you insane like that clown posse?<br>
          Move along like the throngs in Powaqaatsi <br>
          We sling the shit that sticks like bonds of strong epoxy<br>
          Approximately 3 minutes will be lost while we are rocking thee<br>
          My name is hardly known and though it's grown still few have heard<br>
          My name is a killing word I split the spirit from the vessel<br>
          Say it loud, say it proud<br>
          YES I'M SPECIAL!!!!<br>
          We've come to warn 'em of the shit that rock has peddled<br>
          Cause friends don't let friends listen to rap metal<br>
          <br>
          We can agree to settle this like gentlemen<br>
          Or you can try to defy and get beheaded when<br>
          I swing my syntax like a simitar<br>
          Similar to sinbad, you'll get schooled by my seminar<br>
          You still haven't learned what your limits are<br>
          Your remedial rhyming stays simple like simon<br>
          My shit stay tight like rivets are<br>
          While civil liberties are the only guarantees you made it this far<br>
          You pose for Vivitar, while i pose unprobed hypotheses<br>
          Bring drama like Sophocles, smash your monopolies<br>
          Deliver similes like emt's do babies<br>
          In the back seat of a honda civic car<br>
          So through up your fist till your ligaments<br>
          Are pulled in more ways than a mormon polygamist<br>
          And your vocal chords stretch till you're hoarse<br>
          You can't deny the irresistable force<br>
