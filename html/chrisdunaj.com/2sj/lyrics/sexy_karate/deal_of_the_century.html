      <td style="padding-left: 4px"><p> It's been a while that I've been living 
          between the lines<br>
          But I've been a child given a job to speak my mind<br>
          Been an overachiever since day number one<br>
          Brought a chainsaw to my own circumcision<br>
          <br>
          And no rest for the weary<br>
          I'll sleep when I'm six feet deep under the ground dead and buried<br>
          Beyond that until that moment I'll keep on bombin<br>
          For all them swimmin against the stream like salmon spawnin</p>
        <p>I J guy stay fly and rock the hizzouse<br>
          Explode like colon blow when I spit my shit out<br>
          I been there I've been back I've been through it<br>
          So I make music like it's my last day to do it<br>
          <br>
          Chorus<br>
          You can't believe what we got<br>
          When we come to town and we set up shop<br>
          You can't compete with our stock<br>
          Pay attention it's the deal of the century</p>
        <p>Come as you are to our shop<br>
          Holes in your pockets, holes in your socks<br>
          We got enough for you and your flock<br>
          Pay attention it's the deal of the century<br>
          <br>
          We be mop tops, not hot shots that got lots<br>
          Mock yachts, hit hot heads that cock glocks<br>
          In soft spots, we beat the shot clocks that shock jocks<br>
          We show up, set up get up and rock spots</p>
        <p>So here's the deal on our efforts<br>
          We're getting pennies on the dollar for our pounds of flesh<br>
          I'll bet you'll never see me rocking them diamonds and jewels<br>
          Cause our rent checks are best spent on bedspreads on vestibules<br>
          <br>
          We know you know that we'll rock you like pebbles<br>
          And go for mass appeal cause mom says I'm Special<br>
          Yes we'll hit your whole house from grandma to grandson <br>
          All pro, all pack, all that and then some<br>
          <br>
          CHORUS<br>
          <br>
          Motherfucker it's official<br>
          Now I take issue with your position where you assumed I'd take the position<br>
          My delivery gives you arrhythmia heart stoppin <br>
          when I'm rockin shit smooth like Nivea<br>
          Nowadays it seems respect goes to the artist <br>
          who talks loudest not who's the smartest<br>
          My mind is my sharpest armarment, in my arsenal.<br>
          Pick the largest target and make it personal!<br>
          <br>
          CHORUS<br>
