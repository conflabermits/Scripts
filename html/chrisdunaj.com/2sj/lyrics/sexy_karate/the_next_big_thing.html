      <td style="padding-left: 4px"><p><br>
          no doubt i'm quietly freaking out<br>
          where is my mind when i need it now<br>
          i get tongue tied sometimes<br>
          waiting for something to arrive<br>
          and it's coming like a thief in the night<br>
          but the difference can be seen in the light<br>
          and if all i ever had were redemption songs<br>
          i stay strong cuz my mic weighs a ton</p>
        <p>do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars<br>
          do not simply follow<br>
          do not mistake kindness for weakness, time to correct that <br>
          blindness from too much time spent with you left hand<br>
          do not doubt, feel the change at molecular range<br>
          now your reign is endangered<br>
          do not try to pass us by, or sweep this aside<br>
          or your last meal will be your pride</p>
        <p>Chorus<br>
          Your next big thing is over 'cause we're coming along<br>
          oh yeah, oh yeah...<br>
          Here we go the sparks are flying<br>
          It's all so electrifying<br>
          Your next big thing is over 'cause we're coming along</p>
        <p>I've had it now, my brain blanks and panics now<br>
          Smoke stings my eyes, while these tracks scratch like static now<br>
          Songs spawn like rabbits, forces form like habits<br>
          Want it? Have it. Reach it? Grab it.<br>
          If you've heard it once you've heard it twice like bigamist<br>
          Everything is standing in its place paralysis<br>
          I admit to this, I oppose the puppet with ventrilloquist<br>
          I thought it, wrote it and transmitted this</p>
        <p>CHORUS<br>
          <br>
          We're at where it's on 'cause we've been where it's from<br>
          we're goin' off now 'cause it's got to give<br>
          CHORUS </p>
