          Chorus<br>
          One for the corner<br>
          Two for the train<br>
          Three for the kids with the beats on their brains<br>
          Four for the sunshine that's blazing hot<br>
          It's all we got to give, so we give it all we got<br>
          <br>
          It's the best of times, it's the worst of times <br>
          So we got the Gatorade for your thirsty minds<br>
          The flows you breathe in like O2<br>
          That go to your head and get you trippin' like toadstools<br>
          So you know you be in competent hands<br>
          Like a veteran QB who be throwing balls to the stands for the fans<br>
          The band gets you out of your seat <br>
          I get you out of your brain astroplaning the street<br>
          Cuz you gotta pay rent, you gotta make friends<br>
          You gotta stay sane, so when the day ends<br>
          You wanna find yourself where you can lose yourself<br>
          Lookin through yourself so you can prove yourself<br>
          You wanna love a little and laugh a lot<br>
          You wanna be higher than an astronaut<br>
          You never wanna ever have to come up for air<br>
          So we're taking you half way there</p>
        <p>CHORUS<br>
          <br>
          In a field of broken dreams I put my stakes down<br>
          Where pens, amps, mics and strings all come to break ground<br>
          To chase down the great crown of great sounds<br>
          To build upon our life or likely break down<br>
          We race round the playground way up to way down<br>
          day up to day down stay up to lay down<br>
          Tracks and beats, from the front to the back of your seats<br>
          That's got you back on your feet<br>
          You'll be singing for the night, singing for the day<br>
          Singing for the joy of life, singing for our pay<br>
          Listen up kids cuz we've got something to play<br>
          And we'll have good times, good times</p>
        <p>CHORUS<br>
