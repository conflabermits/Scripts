          Chorus<br>
          Close the door and turn the lights low<br>
          Take a second take life slow<br>
          Listen to the sirens in the night's glow<br>
          Insidie my room<br>
          <br>
          Close your eyes and let time stop<br>
          Unwind and let your mind pop<br>
          And just smile while the bomb drop<br>
          Inside my room<br>
          <br>
          i got 4 walls around a 12 foot kingdom<br>
          it's where my heart's at, it's where i sing from<br>
          my land where my fates are smilin,<br>
          come on in and i'll grant you asylum<br>
          posters on the wall anounce a better way<br>
          pictures on the shelf recall a better day<br>
          the monster in the closet turned out to be a friend of mine<br>
          so now it's cool we're tight, i mean we're hangin' out like all the 
          time<br>
          coast to coast i'm known to roam<br>
          renouned mostly for nouns and verbs as i spit sound<br>
          and my flights of fantasy race round reality<br>
          chase down insanity here where i hit ground<br>
          and it's bound to be almost profound to me<br>
          to be sound asleep beneath my roof, between my sheets<br>
          it makes me pause, count blessings, learn lessons<br>
          stop stressin' for a second, then i get back to busy streets</p>
        <p>CHORUS<br>
          <br>
          Here it is the island where I spent my punishment<br>
          Where Boogie monsters boogied<br>
          Where the wild things came and went<br>
          I spend a thousand million hours in my winter's discontent<br>
          Staring out at flowers, during April showers<br>
          But now the door is mine to open or to close as I see fit<br>
          A fort for all my treasures walls to things that don't mean shit<br>
          I elevate my state here when I see my life in pits<br>
          And I've got lip shaped pillows so I'm always being kissed<br>
          We held our secret meetings here<br>
          Belted out the beatings here<br>
          To get the help to find myself I'm be myself retreating here<br>
          We speak a secret greeting here so only friends can pass<br>
          A moat to all my troubles and them I'm free at last<br>
          I'm the dj on the tables, I'm the mc on the mic<br>
          I'm the guy that rocks the solo and the hand that brings the light<br>
          I'm the tears upon my pillow and the frog that sings in spite<br>
          Because the things that come in here are only things I like</p>
