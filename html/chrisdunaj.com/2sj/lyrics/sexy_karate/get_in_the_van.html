          CHORUS <br>
          Here we go on the road<br>
          That's all we have to know<br>
          Cause we be steadily stomping at every show<br>
          <br>
          J put your hands up<br>
          J pull your mic out<br>
          And tear off the roof 'til ConEd turns the lights out<br>
          So here we go, beats and flow, to and fro, Coast to coast<br>
          Act like you know when the crew takes the flow<br>
          Cause we travel through minds across times across lands<br>
          So pack up your stuff kid and get in the van<br>
          <br>
          it's incredible, sometimes it's so close i can taste it<br>
          then it seems so far away i can't face it. embrace it!<br>
          to chase it we take to city streets and interstates<br>
          with frames of featherweights and heavy beats on our plates<br>
          we roll into town like thunder<br>
          commando band of stand-outs handing out propaganda<br>
          it's outlandish how small minds have big range<br>
          and loud voices - it's time for a change!<br>
          and it comes from the people - are you with me?<br>
          who stand up and challenge the authority - come get me<br>
          watch the flock drop yellin' hit me like britney, spineless and mindless<br>
          while out in the yard rocking hard's where you'll find us<br>
          cuz we've spent years where the adventurous be<br>
          ask 'em who enters their headspace, they'll mention me<br>
          go round for round, but understand fully<br>
          i rebound like the class clown after being pounded by bullies</p>
        <p>CHORUS<br>
          <br>
          You must rise when the night falls <br>
          Pound the ground, town to town when your life calls<br>
          Will you stand still? Or walk tall?<br>
          Will you write that hit single, hit song, hit walls <br>
          I've fallen and I've still got the scars<br>
          I've been blinded but I still see the stars<br>
          Cause we did this the hard way down parkways in broad day<br>
          And hit all the causeways from bumfuck to to broadway<br>
          Big hearts, hit roads and dodge darts<br>
          Rip shows, flip flows and rock hard<br>
          To the upstart pop stars who top charts<br>
          You've sold yourself for stolen gold, but what of art?<br>
          So stand with me stand with me<br>
          Lift your fists up<br>
          Band with me band with me<br>
          We can do this right together<br>
          We can make a change for the better <br>
          and exchange the winds of change for stormy weather<br>
