In the mid 1990’s, however, scientists began debating whether Pluto had been misclassified.

It was thought that Pluto had perhaps been an asteroid that simply got caught in the sun’s gravitational pull billions of years ago. Hence, to us, our oldest known immigrant. When asked his opinion about the controversy, the planet’s discoverer replied that if for no other reason, we should keep Pluto’s planetary status for the sake of children who have learned about 9 planets.
