              This song goes out to those with coke bottle glasses <br>
              To all you lonely kids who were the last pick in gym classes <br>
              We got your back - detract your malefactors <br>
              All you up in the back unite like Thundercats <br>
              Get up, get up, 'cause we're fed up, fed up <br>
              Try to rise and keep your head up, head up <br>
              Leave the kinging to Kong, we'll be singing our song <br>
              Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on <br>
              It's a sentimental journey <br>
              Presenting sentiments of resentment that would burn me <br>
              Unearthing archives of sharp knives turning blunt <br>
              My road is to unfold, so I gotta face the front <br>
              I used to spend my days dazed and confused <br>
              16 year underdog still donning Under-roos <br>
              Sorry Busta, I know my flow sounds used <br>
              Written and directed by the likes of John Hughes <br>
              Recycled recitals of rewritten idylls <br>
              Are scrawled in the hall like Anthony Michael <br>
              I lack land and title, just one of the boys <br>
              On islands and islands of misfit toys </font>
              <p>CHORUS</p>
              <p>My field of dreams was a parking lot <br>
                With hot shots doing donuts and pissin' off the grown-ups <br>
                Me on the side writing unrequited love letters <br>
                That I would send to my imaginary girlfriend <br>
                I had to pretend cuz I never played football <br>
                The kid drafted last pick at the roll call <br>
                To ease the monotony of everybody mockin me <br>
                I spent time to tend rhymes like botany <br>
                Now what I wanna be? What you wanna be? <br>
                Maybe famous, I claim this, try to gain this <br>
                But sometimes it's heinous the way the shameless <br>
                Surround me like a tide and drown me <br>
                So I'm looking for intelligent life forms <br>
                I'm looking for a blip on the screen <br>
                So I can reach out and touch somebody, anybody <br>
                Everybody</p>
              <p>Oooo Wah Oooo Wah Oooo Wah, Oooo Oooo Oooo Oooo</p>
