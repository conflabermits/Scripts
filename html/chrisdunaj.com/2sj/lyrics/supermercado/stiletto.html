Since the rule was established by the Supreme Court in the 1966 case Miranda v.

The rule recently came under scrutiny when the 4th U.S. Court of Appeals, in Richmond, Va., ruled that a largely ignored 1968 federal law allowing voluntary confessions as evidence must take precedence over the requirement that a suspect be informed of his or her Miranda rights.
