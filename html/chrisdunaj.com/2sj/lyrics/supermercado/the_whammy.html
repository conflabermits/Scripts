            <td style="padding-left: 4px">Look deep into my iris <br>
              Mysteries unfold beyond scrolls of papyrus <br>
              Your mind flips - the hieroglyphs are explicit <br>
              Ancient arts from other parts of existence <br>
              Scribes from the tribes of Hebrews and Nubians <br>
              Passed through to the true blue like cerulean <br>
              The source of my voice be the key to truly enhance <br>
              Now you dance to the trance that you be in <br>
              Excellent like dumpling - its fabulous <br>
              Heaven sent like the coming - miraculous <br>
              Ain't it somethin' how we do with gumption <br>
              It's a safe assumption that we get the party bumpin' <br>
              Small wonder that you're under my influence <br>
              It's over, I'm takin' over in increments <br>
              As I tighten in my vice like Miami <br>
              The super bad osu got you movin' to the power of the whammy <br>
              Get down, get down, listen to the sound <br>
              &gt;From your earlobe to your frontal lobe the whammy's got ya bound 
              <p>The power of suggestion's got you on your knees genuflecting 
                <br>
                Dimensions arise before your eyes <br>
                Disguised, your new initials - DUI <br>
                You try to flex your force, influenced under mine <br>
                We spread to your head like infection <br>
                The ghost in my throat, tones and inflections make connections 
                <br>
                Between resistant synapses <br>
                Your willpower snapses, we transmit like faxes <br>
                We vanquish the masses like Allies to Axis <br>
                You dances - you dances <br>
                You're tricked by the tricks you designed <br>
                The toungue is quicker than the mind <br>
                We'll bewitch you with rituals <br>
                We bring emerging energies, forming mass from individuals <br>
                With residuals the kid quits, but can he? <br>
                I'll hit him with the whammy <br>
                It's the whammy y'all<br>
