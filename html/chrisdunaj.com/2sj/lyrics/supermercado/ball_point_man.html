                and Peace</a><br>
                I fight beasts armed to the teeth on the daily <br>
                My pen is my sword and thank Lord never fails me. <br>
                I remember back in the days of my youth <br>
                When I used to run around on the block with a few friends <br>
                Nickers and Kickers and stickers on our Big Wheels, <br>
                Mindtricks and Kung Fu grips was the big deal. <br>
                At nighttime we'd fight crime defending civilians <br>
                Mounting extra sensory offenses against the villians by the millions 
                <br>
                No defiance to our allegiance cause we instilled fear, <br>
                <a href="javascript:popup('Jimmy quit, Joey got married, (Bryan Adams, Summer of ’69',4)" class="pn-text">Jimmy quit, Joey 
                got married</a>, but I'm still here</p>
              <p>I've got my head in the clouds but I'm grounded. <br>
                This superhero steps to the pavement and I pound it. <br>
                hounded by the sound of unfounded speculation <br>
                by authorities around to confound the population. <br>
                Now most host ghosts -- I propose to break the shell.<br>
                The coffee shop cop rides in to dispell <br>
                These visions of cathedrals from a shopping mall, <br>
                And philosophy from a bathroom wall. <br>
                And so I strike without hesitation, the forces had to yield<br>
                To my devastation my notebook is my battlefield <br>
                I roam <a href="javascript:popup('tomes (books, often of knowledge)',5)" class="pn-text">tomes</a> 
                of zones where spirals spin around<br>
                And I can leap a metaphor in a single bound </p>
              <p>I'm biding my time <br>
                I'm biding my time waiting for a sign to be sent to me <br>
                to unleash the power of my secret identity, <br>
                but until that day I will stay for the time being <br>
                Incognito laying low with my rhyme scheme<br>
                Well Shazaam! I Marvel like the captain<br>
                At my <a href="javascript:popup('inopportune (happening at a bad moment or an inconvenient time) ',6)" class="pn-text">inopportune 
                </a>impotence in the face of distraction, <br>
                Inaction makes me a good guy also-ran<br>
                So I battle Black Mantas in the bathtub like Aquaman<br>
                Minions of evil heed this <a href="javascript:popup('tirade (a long angry speech)',7)" class="pn-text">tirade</a><br>
                it's a parade of <a href="javascript:popup('polemics (a passionate, strongly worded, and often controversial argument against or, less often, in favor of something or somebody)',8)" class="pn-text">polemics</a> 
                and I love a parade <br>
                So I ride into the sunset with the money and the girl <br>
                But in my spare time I still save the world </p>
