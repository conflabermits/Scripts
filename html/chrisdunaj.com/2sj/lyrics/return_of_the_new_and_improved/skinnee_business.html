            <td style="padding-left: 4px"> I said, &quot;Yo, this is a mic test&quot;<br>
              Are you ready for the two skinnee likeness? <br>
              You gotta look hard to find cause we are not high profile <br>
              Can't catch us cause we go high speed mobile <br>
              So accept your fate, you're on the skinnee time<br>
              we're copping cold jams as the riffage for the rhyme <br>
              We are the rap band who puts the band back in rap <br>
              So stand back and accept the slap or our tunes <br>
              They line the table cause to the ears they're food <br>
              Easy to swallow cause they come pre-chewed <br>
              My rhymes are unsightly, I say them uptightly, <br>
              But don't take me lightly cause we know you be sight we <br>
              Come to the stage, rock the mic cause we like it <br>
              Got out of our cage we got flaws we don't hide it <br>
              We're humble when we stumbe, not a king of the jungle<br>
              Just tumble out the tunes that you've never heard before <br>
              Hip hoppin, hard rockin, foot stompin gore <br>
              You've heard us once, n ow you gotta here some more 
              <p>CHORUS<br>
                We've got some business that we got to fix <br>
                So we brought our skinnee posse and our big fat mix<br>
                We got gainful employment so we don't have to rob <br>
                And if you buy our tape then we can quit our job<br>
                I ain't punching a clock and I ain't wearing a tie <br>
                Gonna do the skinnee business till the day I die <br>
                <br>
                Pay attention to my speakin as I rock your intellect <br>
                come get your daily dose like an oral contraceptive <br>
                Respect this, cause I kill the ill at they conception <br>
                Let the skinnee vibe as we strive for perfection <br>
                Use my tongue to kick it like Kung Fu, shinobi <br>
                found the fiends were hounding me like Ahab to Moby<br>
                I don't have no time to waste on bug competition <br>
                Put it all into rhyme, even the sink in the kitchen<br>
                I go on and on until my mission is completed foes are defeated, 
                mistakes are deleted <br>
                It's the tower of my life that I'm trying to erect <br>
                Over the blueprints of my soul I'm the skinnee architect <br>
                So listen cause this one's for the people of the planet <br>
                We be brother and sister, like Tito and Janet<br>
                I'm skinnee and I slam it <br>
                So please baby, please <br>
                With these I get my soul on and then the skinnee's roll on <br>
                There's no business like Skinnee business, like no business I 
                know <br>
                I got no business with that ho business cause that ho business 
                gotta go<br>
                I trade a ho for a Ho Ho, Twinkie or a Ring Ding, <br>
                onion ring, six pack Big Mac snack attack,<br>
                I like food and betties, I'm hungry and I'm sweaty, <br>
                and I'm ready to get on with my business </p>
              <p>Chorus</p>
