            <td style="padding-left: 4px"> Check out the scene, we're stuck in a tractor beam <br>
              With the R-2 Unit and the whole skinnee team <br>
              From the moons of Endor to the Land of Lando <br>
              We take the whole damn posse to wherever the van goes <br>
              The chase is on and we're close to capture <br>
              Imperial forces don't really know what they're after <br>
              Which way did they go? Which way did they go? <br>
              Excuse me for the question but I really got to know <br>
              My rosy glasses give me passage inside the minds of masses <br>
              So relax when I ask this <br>
              Did you come to kick my ass, or get your ass kicked?<br>
              I'm a mellow fellow not afraid of being yellow <br>
              But will I run from a gun when confronted hell no. <br>
              Like Obi Wan I'll use the force. <br>
              These are not the J's you're looking for 
              <p>I hold my light saber with precision and envision the invader's 
                demolition, <br>
                Rebel on a mission <br>
                To defeat 'em red leader gonna be there in a flash <br>
                Exit to the X-Wing flexing with the crash <br>
                Skinnee's in control. Now we go for gold. <br>
                Like Han but never Solo cause my crew be in the hold <br>
                Chilling like Hoth they can't touch us with their blasters <br>
                We learned at the feet of the masters <br>
                It's an old Jedi Mind Trick <br>
                Hold up I froze up when the speeders showed up <br>
                The shield's are down and the shit's about to blow up <br>
                Imperial forces want to force us to extinction <br>
                But my force is from the source, so of course I trust my instincts<br>
