              Now I'm busting' out the playpen <br>
              It's the era of J Gueverra <br>
              Sparking' revolutions like in <a href="javascript:popup(' (Guantanamera – With music written by Joseíto Fernández, and words adapted from a poem by Jose Marti, this popular ballad became a solidarity hymn worldwide for supporters of Fidel Castro s revolution)',0);" >Guantanamera</a><br>
              The thought of getting' played from the hands of the creator <br>
              <a href="javascript:popup('Locusts (One of the seven plagues sent by God to punish the Egyptians for holding the Jews as slaves) ',1);" >Locusts</a> devouring all the 
              hocus pocus <br>
              Focus on the force as the curious unloads<br>
              Contents under pressure, about to explode <br>
              like Lou Ferigno mean and green so check my signal <br>
              Its the Skinnee individual who did you well <br>
              I kid you not I bid you to stop if you’ve gotta scheme<br>
              Cuz my team bring the steam like hot water<br>
              On the oasis and the race is run <br>
              Now its time to take my place in the sun<br>
              <br>
              YOU CAN'T DENY THE FORCE (NO, YOU CAN'T) <br> <br>
              Resistance is futile, we've got parental approval <br>
              It's best just not to test us cause our feuds get feudal <br>
              It's brutal, so expect some <a href="javascript:popup('(self-punishment or an act of religious devotion performed to show sorrow for having committed a sin) ',3);" >penance</a>. 
              <br>
              There'll be no <a href="javascript:popup('dangling participles (a participle that is not grammatically linked to the word it is intended to modify. In [Driving down the street, the house came into view], driving is a dangling participle) ',4);" >dangling participles</a> 
              or<a href="javascript:popup(' supspended sentences (a sentence imposed on somebody found guilty of a crime that need not be served as long as the individual commits no other crime during the term of the sentence)',5);" > suspended sentences</a>.<br>
              Your <a href="javascript:popup(' . (a sentence imposed on somebody found guilty of a crime that need not be served as long as the individual commits no other crime during the term of the sentence.)',7);" >suppression</a> of evidence 
              will get met with <a href="javascript:popup(' belligerence (the quality of being hostile, ready to start a fight, or ready to go to war)',8);" >belligerence</a><br>
              You'll give hesitant penance cause at the present you're tense, 
              hence <br>
              Your confession is expected<br>
              If you think that we're persistent in our methods, yes you guessed 
              it<br>
              Blessed are we who come in the name of J<br>
              Our word spreads like Parkay<br>
              Oh I declare! It's a state of emergency <br>
              The president <a href="javascript:popup(' assents (to agree to something or express agreement) ',9);" >assents</a> so 
              don't expect <a href="javascript:popup('clemency (an instance of showing mercy or leniency) ',10);" >clemency</a> <br>
              Depend on me, my tendency is to judge forgivingly<br>
              You can't resist the Skinnee, so give yourself up willingly<br>
              Still I be feeling the paw of Marshall law, you see? <br>
