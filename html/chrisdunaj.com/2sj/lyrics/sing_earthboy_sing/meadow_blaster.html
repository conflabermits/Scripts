              The J's in the dell <br>
              The J's in the dell <br>
              Hi ho the merrio the J's in the dell </font>
              <p>Old Skinnee J had a farm EE EYE OH<br>
                Planted breeds of the seeds and I heed to watch them grow <br>
                Frrom knee high to sky high body and in spirit <br>
                Here a rhyme there a rhyme everywhere a lyric <br>
                Our delivery is candid with band-aid adhesion <br>
                Made it through the changes weathered all the seasons <br>
                Now it is the winter of our discontent <br>
                Made glorious summer 2 Skinnee is the magic number <br>
                And I wonder awake from your slumber <br>
                The blindfold around your mind and soul is torn asunder <br>
                So you wake up to greet the day <br>
                It's the dawn in the house of J </p>
              <p>Well I'm an international harvester so here's a harbinger of 
                things to come <br>
                Emerge the one Special J that's prehensile <br>
                I've been wrestled from my nestle on the vessel of the wind swept 
                plain <br>
                To obtain my weight in grain <br>
                It's the cycle of the seasons and here we go again <br>
                We how rows with our flows as we sows all we knows <br>
                Into grooves and furrows using bulls and burroughs <br>
                Storing all we've grown in a mile high silo <br>
                Laying claim to our domain with our deeds and titles <br>
                I kneel to idols to grow my pastures faster <br>
                That's how it is with the old meadowblaster </p>
              <p>Reaping props like crops and sowing rhymes like seeds <br>
                We're springing like the chicken and we're stinging like bees 
                <br>
                Wee wee wee like the piggy heading all the way home <br>
                It's the leaders of the sheep and like the cheese I stand alone 
                <br>
                And I get down like the rain on the plain for sure <br>
                So God damn this you're not in Kansas anymore <br>
                Do you dare go where a scarecrow will slay a witch <br>
                And the hills are alive with the sound of chickens<font class="pn-normal"><br>
