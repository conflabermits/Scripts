              So turn down your lights, and turn up your speakers<br>
              Everybody dance around cuz we're all social creatures<br>
              Knock knock - who is it? We're being paid a visit<br>
              By notable nobles with visions of white picket fences<br>
              Foreign cars and platinum expenses<br>

              Or put four kicks to the floor, but I'll be honest<br>
              We ain't turnin' down till the sun comes up<br>
              The sound gets sucked through pipes and ducts<br>
              So rise and shine, hear the party line<br>

              Chorus:<br>
              It ain't loud enough for all of us<br>

              All your plots and schemes have been foiled, see<br>
              I got lines and quotes - the rhymes I wrote<br>
