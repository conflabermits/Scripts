              to free fall<br>
              The girl sets my heart racing, but my engine is stalled<br>
              Now I pace myself 'cause I gotta stay in front man<br>
              Blast like an astronaut, crash like a stunt man<br>
              To worlds where witty boys get the pretty girls they merit<br>
              But she holds the saddle, the stick, the carrot<br>

              As she fills me with thrills like a roller coaster<br>
              Or slams me with amps like a bath with a toaster<br>
              Now my knees are shaking and I find my spine is gone<br>
              From holding up the pedestal that I've put her on<br>
              I should've studied science cause I tend to forget<br>
              <a href="javascript:popup(' (The relationship between FORCE and motion was expressed by Isaac NEWTON in his three laws of motion: (1) a body at rest tends to remain at rest, or a body in motion tends to remain in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless acted on by an outside force; (2) the acceleration a of a mass m by a force F is directly proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the mass, or a=F/m; (3) for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The third law implies that the total MOMENTUM of a system of bodies not acted on by an external force remains constant.)',2)" class="pn-text">That for every action there's

              Well I must've slept through that one, cause now I'm on thin ice 
              with no traction<br> <br>
              CHORUS<br>
              Is she thinking of you? No she just thought she knew me<br>
              But she's looking at you! No she's looking through me<br>
              And now I realize I've got no shape or size to the girl with the 
              world in her eyes<br>
              So I keep bouncing<br> <br>
              <a href="javascript:popup(' (shakespeare sonnet #18)',3)" class="pn-text">Shall I compare thee to a summer's

              <br>
              Steered by butterfly eyes while drinking drinks of siren's tears<br>
              I fear the reaper cause it's hard like heavy metal<br>
              When the beasts that you beat off are handsome devils<br>
              Yet, the consequence of compliments<br>
              Is that I am graced with graces periodic like the elements<br>
              Her imminence influences subatomics<br>
              So I want to do her right <br>
              Like Shakespeare does a sonnet<br>
              I'm on it. Harrassed by bees in bonnets<br>
              Slave to her affection like gramps to gin and tonics<br>
              Loyal to my master like a pack of Pekinese<br>
              While I try to hold my place with weakened knees<br>
              CHORUS<br> <br>
              Maybe I should call you up so we can spend some time together<br>
              Take a walk or have some dinner, I don't care I'll do whatever<br>
              My heart shivers every single time I get a busy signal<br>
              Can I get an operator?<br>
              So you know if she said bounce with me, I'd bounce with her<br>
              Cause every minute that I'm in it counts with her<br>
              There's only one sin I wouldn't renounce for her<br>
              And if she gave me half a glance then I would counsel her <br>
              That she should bounce with me, so I can bounce with her<br>
              Cause every minute that I'm in it really counts with her<br>
              There's only one sin I wouldn't renounce for her<br>
              But do I have a chance!<br> <br>
              Chorus<br>
              Yeah, she's got the world in her eyes</td>
