            <td style="padding-left: 4px">I do it this way from the first to the seventh day<br>
              Stay on target like an x-wing flexing my brain<br>
              As I state my claim that my aim is to do this properly<br>
              Watch me dismiss your snobbery promptly<br>
              As if my soul could be another man's property <br>
              You gotta be joking, think a minute about what you've been smoking<br>
              Before you start choking and gasping and asking, &quot;who knew?&quot; 
              <br>
              It's simple. I'm cheeky like dimple<br>
              I jump up I get the thumbs up like a thimble<br>
              It ain't what you're thinking, though<br>
              I'm known to be prone to kick over thrones and leave governments 
              overthrown<br>
              Charismatic with the verbal acrobatic<br>
              Top gun take your breath away and leave you asthmatic<br>
              It's automatic that my standards are raised to the attic and my 
              tone is <a href="javascript:popup(' emphatic (to express oneself in forceful speech)',0)" class="pn-text">emphatic</a><br>
              Feel the movement, it's fluid like sand in the hour glass<br>
              How could I stand to let even a single hour pass<br>
              Without bounding ahead and thinking far back<br>
              I take to the sky, you're grounded on the <a href="javascript:popup('tarmac (a runway) ',1)" class="pn-text">tarmac</a><br> 
              <br>
              If there's a mic to be rocked, I will throw the first stone<br>
              I cross time zones, root like <a href="javascript:popup(' rhizomes (a root plant (eg. potato); a somewhat elongate usually horizontal subterranean plant stem that is often thickened by deposits of reserve food material, produces shoots above and roots below, and is distinguished from a true root in possessing buds, nodes, and usually scalelike leaves)',2)" class="pn-text">rhizomes</a> 
              with my rhyme <a href="javascript:popup(' tomes (BOOK; especially : a large or scholarly book)',3)" class="pn-text">tomes</a><br>
              I'm not alone, my friend's found 5 strong<br>
              We reciting rhymes so you can sing along. So sing along!<br>
              We got the tasty treats to fill your mouth so open wide<br>
              We serve poetic justice. Stay open all night.<br>
              While I can't understand why shit gets held high<br>
              Those fads that won't die. They just won't so<br>
              I sleepwalk the street talk like <a href="javascript:popup(' somnambulist (sleepwalker)',4)" class="pn-text">somnambulist</a><br>
              We rock like amethyst, we rare like <a href="javascript:popup(' ambergris (a waxy substance found in the intestines of the sperm whale, and used in perfumery as a fixative. Highly valuable ambergris is an important symbol in Moby Dick) ',5)" class="pn-text">ambergris</a><br>
              It's scandalous music planned by <a href="javascript:popup('avarice (greed)',7)" class="pn-text">avarice</a><br>
              You're sorely misinformed like c-span panelist<br>
              I never planned on this<br>
              Big beat evangelist<br>
              Wack track antagonist, <br>
              Pass raps through dialysis<br>
              But we stand by this<br>
              So here's a code to those who know to throw up your right fist, 
              like this<br>
              But when it pours you know it's raining<br>
              These rats in races got me <a href="javascript:popup('pistol-whipped like stamens (pistil -- the ovule bearing female organ of a flower; stamens -- the pollen-producing male organ of a flower)',7)" class="pn-text">pistol-whipped 
              like stamens</a><br>
              I ain't complaining, though, just hopping off this fence<br>
              Cause when it's all said and done things will finally come togther 
              and make some sense<br></td>
