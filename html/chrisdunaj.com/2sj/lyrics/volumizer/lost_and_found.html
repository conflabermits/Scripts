              you came looking for fun and you found that<br>
              heart on your sleeve, gum on your shoes<br>
              looking this year's model, feeling yesterday's news<br>
              so you take off running like a dog at a racetrack<br>
              crowded in like clowns in a hatchback<br>
              into your own, out in the night<br>
              you get a tan from the spotlight 
              <p>chorus<br>
                lost and found in the mirror now<br>
                coming down, getting clearer now<br>
                coming round, getting nearer now<br>
                lost and found</p>
              <p>you never say a word you would take back<br>
                you came looking for truth and they faked that<br>
                selling out, buying in<br>
                trading capitol gains and original sin<br>
                so you come out swinging like it's time for some payback<br>
                too late, out of date like an eight track<br>
                fade to black, fade to grey<br>
                tired of it anyway</p>
              <p>chorus</p>
              <p>and you say<br>
                it might me hard, but it sure looks easy to me<br>
                it might seem funny, but it don't look funny to me<br>
                cuz they keep on talking but they still ain't talking to me<br>
                and they think they're ready but they sure ain't ready for me</p>
              <p>find time to shine before the last act<br>
                you came looking for faith but you're past that<br>
                comedy and tragedy<br>
                when irony is your strategy<br>
                so you jump up singing on cue like a laugh track<br>
                switch lanes or remain in the fast track<br>
                you don't know, you don't care <br>
                see you when you get there<br>
                chorus<br>
              </p>
