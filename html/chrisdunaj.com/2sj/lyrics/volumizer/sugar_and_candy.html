            <td style="padding-left: 4px"> It was five forty five on a Friday<br>
              I was waiting for a train going my way<br>
              I stood packed on a platform to Brooklyn<br>
              Where everybody's pushin' but nobody's lookin'<br>
              So I got crushed in the rush for the subway<br>
              By the little old men trying to shove me<br>
              I noticed her when I glanced sideways<br>
              And felt continents shifting inside me<br>
              I was dressed in my best polyester<br>
              And I could tell that the plastic impressed her<br>
              Cuz she smiled as she eased up beside me<br>
              And then she said she had things to confide, see<br>
              She said her dad ran away with Samantha<br>
              The middle aged exotic dancer<br>
              So her mom had returned to her savior<br>
              And here's the advice that he gave her<br>
              He said Reese's Pieces, swedish fish<br>
              Oodles of Skittles and red licorice<br>
              Marshmallow, mints and a chocolate kiss<br>
              And it melts in your mouth like this<br> <br>
              Chorus:<br>
              Take off your contacts and look at the screen<br>
              Take off your make-up and look at the scene<br>
              If you break your restrictions then you'll understand me<br>
              Take your prescription of sugar and candy - oh yeah<br> <br>
              We arrived there by way of the highway<br>
              After night drives with trade winds and <a href="javascript:popup(' tirades (A long speech usually marked by intemperate, vituperative, or harshly censorious language. In other words, yelling criticism at someone.)',0)" class="pn-text">tirades</a><br>
              To a town bound by old guards and drydocks<br>
              Bored I dragged my ass off the bus and hit the sidewalks<br>
              I stumbled on a lane name of my way<br>
              And got caught in a stream by treading lightly<br>
              The fish passed me by led by fishhooks<br>
              I hit pop flies and caught their strange looks<br>
              But one figure struggled just to stand there<br>
              He was a one-legged man in his wheelchair<br>
              I struck out a course for his landing<br>
              He put out a hand and then he grabbed me<br>
              He told a life time of boxcars and by-ways<br>
              Of the times of stockyards and chaingangs and two legs<br>
              He offered his advice for a penny<br>
              And for that small price here's what he gave me<br> <br>
              Chorus</td>
