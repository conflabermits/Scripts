              got an old rent controlled and a brand new sedan<br>
              i'm on hold with con edison<br>
              the space heater went dead again
              <p>she played the cop, i played the martyr<br>
                she got the rock, i rocked the party<br>
                she got the credit and i got carded</p>
              <p>Chorus<br>
                i have hardly grown up since you met me<br>
                i might never grow up if you let me<br>
                if i had to do it all over, well i'd do it again<br>
                i'd come running right back to all the trouble i'm in<br>
                because i have hardly grown up since you met me</p>
              <p>i never learn but i like to pretend<br>
                and i've got lots of company in my circle of friends<br>
                she never calls but she never forgets<br>
                she's got a secret tattoo with my home address</p>
              <p>she told the truth, i told the story<br>
                she got the goods, i got the glory<br>
                she's never wrong and i'm never sorry</p>
              <p>chorus</p>
              <p>and sometimes i wish i could be more like you were<br>
                and sometimes you wish you could be more like me</p>
              <p>you've got that look in your eyes and you're clicking your teeth<br>
                you've got the answer on the tip of your tounge<br>
                you've got an itchy trigger finger and you're pointing at me<br>
                with the barrel of a loaded gun</p>
              <p>she's gone away and she'l never return<br>
                cuz i never met a bridge that i couldn't burn</p>
