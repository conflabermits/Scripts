              I abhor your tortures, but there will be no confessions from me<br>

              but it's not my fault<br>
              I heard the rumor had a rendezvous<br>
              Well, yes, it came on by my place but it passed right through<br>
              I've made mistake before, yes I must be fair<br>
              I saw YOU drop the ball like at New Year's, Times Square<br>

They were at first identified as Calvinists, due to the missionary efforts of John Calvin the Swiss reformer. Included in this group were the Waldenses of Southern France. In 1560, they began being called Huguenots. The origin of the name is unknown. They grew in great numbers in France, until they became a threat to Roman rule there. Starting in 1538, a policy of religious war was practiced to try and bring the French Huguenots back under Roman rule. Between 1559 and 1598 eight fierce wars were fought. The terrible massacre of St. Batholomew was begun in 1572. Over 2000 Hugeunots were murdered in Paris on the nights of August 23 and 24. In all as many as twenty thousand were murdered and their property seized by the Roman Catholics. For a brief period the persecution ended with Henry IV, and ex-Huguenot. However, in 1685, Louis XIV, revoked the order of tolerance and the Huguenots in mass fled France to England, Prussia, Holland, South Africa and the Carolinas in America. Because they were the skilled artisans of France and professional middle class, their departure was a serious blow to the French economy)',4)" class="pn-text">Huegonots</a><br>

              And it lands in the hands of the nappy head<br> <br>
              I rise to my defense, counsel approach the bench<br>
              Relaxed in the past but I'm in the present tense<br>

              Attractive as a scapegoat, but I'm sorry<br>
              Have to find fault with the ones that came before me<br>
