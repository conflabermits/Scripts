                yourself surrounded <br>
                Astounded by the veteran crew that you discounted<br>
                But we're back for our piece of this game<br>
                And we remain on a mission to increase the recognition of the 
                name<br>
                That you saw on the marquee when you walked in the building<br>
                To the show, thought you brought your potholes, but we filled 
                'em<br>
                It's just one of our tricks, we're in the mix like trail<br>
                The mic in my hand is like a Molotov Cocktail<br>
                Igniting your vicinity from now until infinity<br>
                Burning it down, we build it back from the ground up<br>

                are back on a round up -<br>
                But we're trying to reach the folks in the back, so turn the sound 
                up <br>
                We blow like a dart through the heart of your crew<br>
                Cause everybody in our squad rocks harder than you<br>
                Every thought that we drop comes smarter than you<br>
                And I know that our presence is bothering you<br>
                The beat breaks and we shake the crowd<br>
                Darken the horizon like a mushroom cloud<br>
                Starship troopers battle on in this insect babylon 5, we drop 
                hard like a <a href="javascript:popup('gavel (mallet used for commanding attention)',1)" class="pn-text">gavel</a><br>
                Rhyming got us climbing to the top this profession<br>
                Some take us for granted, but still we keep 'em guessing<br>
                Yes, it's the S, oh my, the K I, double N, double E<br>
                With more suds than bubbly<br>
                So we propose a toast for those out to win this<br>
                Drink up, now get down to business<br>
                Don't adjust your set if you see any redness<br>
                People's Movement of Rock, you can't prevent this <br>
                <br>
                Chorus<br>
                <br>
                Loud and clear we all shout and cheer <br>
                My arrival marks a change in your <a href="javascript:popup('hegemon (leader - root of hegemony - preponderant influence or authority esp. Of one nation over others)',2)" class="pn-text">hegemon</a><br>

                And if you want to get a piece, just cross the <a href="javascript:popup('Rubicon (stream that in the days of early Rome divided Gaul from Italy. In 49 B.C.

                And bring your battle to the streets of <a href="javascript:popup('Joralemon (street where borough government of Brooklyn, NY sits)',6)" class="pn-text">Joralemon</a><br>
                There I'll squash you like a <a href="javascript:popup('hexapod (insect)',7)" class="pn-text">hexepod</a>, 
                whereupon<br>
                Even if you had six mouths it wouldn't help you on that mic you're 
                on<br>
                While you were getting off I still had my rock on<br>
                Things went from bad to worse for you like Michael Jackson<br>
                I'll push you in 8 ways like an <a href="javascript:popup('octopawn (made it up like the guys in digital underground)',8)" class="pn-text">octopawn</a> 
                <br>
                Then I'll recreate you in one less than 8 days like this rock 
                we're on<br>
                Then I'll blow your shit up once again like your name was <a href="javascript:popup('Alderaan (planet destroyed by death star in Star Wars)',9)" class="pn-text">Alderaan</a><br>
                'cause you're an original like Psycho starring Vince Vaughn<br>
                So go ahead, rhyme along<br>
                Go ahead, rap along, tag along<br>
                Hop along, sing along<br>
                We'll be making points while your lips flap and babble on<br>
                Here's a message to both you and your henchmen<br>
                We've got secret weapons that we've still yet to mention<br>
                We keep 'em ducking, it's shit we're flinging<br>
                You can knock us down but we come up swinging<br>
