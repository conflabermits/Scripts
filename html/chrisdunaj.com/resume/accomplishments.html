				<h1>Accomplishments</h1>
				<p>Accomplishments specific to current role:
					<ul>
						<li>I'm the go-to person for all tasks related to our central metrics, monitoring, and scripting server. This server hosts many tools, files, and other resources that make it easier for our team and other teams to do our jobs. It monitors the health and status of all of our machines on a daily and ad-hoc (triggered by changes) basis; it allows us to collect information and files from our servers, including product version numbers, user limit values, filesystem usage, existence of files or strings in files on servers; and hosts a db, some pages, and some automated scripting logic that runs a web front-end that we and other teams use to get at-a-glance info about our environment and servers.</li>
						<li>Acted as a co-lead web/infra engineer on a portal services upgrade project, moving from 32-bit to 64-bit and from WebSphere Application Server version 6.1 to version 8.5. I worked with a teammate to make sure our Linux boxes had what we needed, installed packages and software, developed file and naming standards, created and deployed code to JVMs, performed troubleshooting on issues, and hit our mark for a successful go-live.</li>
						<li>Acted as the lead web/infra engineer on our latest mobile project. I worked independently from my team to collect information, gather necessary project resources for meetings and troubleshooting, and push back on potentially damaging or dangerous ideas and decisions. I worked to exceed expectations by adding additional status-checking features and better organization to the servers to ensure ongoing management would remain easy. Despite my additions to the process, my work was delivered on time (often ahead of time) and was never a bottleneck or blocker to the progress of the project.</li>
						<li>As a result of my work on the mobile project, and from working with our other mobile servers to "bring them into the fold" with our WebSphere servers (so they would get the same monitoring/scripting treatments), I'm now the go-to person for all things mobile as well.</li>
						<li>I'm currently a co-lead web/infra engineer on another portal upgrade project with similar goals (moving to 64-bit and to WebSphere Portal version 8). The scope of this project is much larger, hitting two of our portals instead of one, and the main portal involved is our major customer portal, the biggest and arguably most public of our web portals (aside from the main company website). We recently finished go-live on the main portal, but still have work to finish on the other portal, as well as additional environments to build out for various forms of testing and development.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>General accomplishments:
					<ul>
						<li>Various Cigna Champion (monetary) and Everyday Champion (morale) awards</li>
						<li>Connecticut Technology Innovators Scholar</li>
						<li>Accenture Scholar</li>
						<li>Capital Scholar</li>
						<li>Presidential Scholar</li>
						<li>Graduate of the Beta Theta Pi Men of Principle Institute</li>
						<li>Graduate of the Undergraduate Interfraternity Institute (UIFI)</li>
						<li>Graduate of Cigna's Technology Early Career Development Program (TECDP)</li>
