				<h1>Work Experience (as an essay)</h1>
				<p>(Click <a href="./work.html">here</a> for a bullet summary of my work experience.)</p>
				<p>I worked for Cigna as an intern in the summer of 2007, and 
returned as a full-time employee in June of 2008. Both the internship 
and my initial full-time employment were classified as an associate of the 
Technology Early Career Development Program (TECDP). The TECDP is a 
rotational program where associates receive specialized training and 
mentoring as they transition through roles in different teams within 
Cigna.</p>
				<p>During my internship with Cigna, I stayed with other interns in 
an apartment community in Manchester, Connecticut, where we could commute together
 to work and socialize together outside of work. During my internship, I
 was on the Testing and Quality Control (TQC) team. The TQC lab imaged 
and built the physical hardware used for troubleshooting and testing of 
new software and updates for Cigna computers. In addition to helping 
with our standard duties on the team, I also learned a great deal about 
VMWare enterprise solutions as my team began the transition from a 
physical to a virtual test environment.</p>
				<p>My first rotation in the full-time TECDP program was on the Web Administration Team. As a member
 of the team, I performed IIS changes and code move-ups in production 
and test environments. I worked in Windows and UNIX operating system 
environments to move, prepare, and run files, and often using IBM WebSphere and BEA 
WebLogic application server consoles. About halfway through the rotation, I was given the Service
 Lead role on the team, where I coordinated the monthly release 
activities between my team and other teams, managers, and stakeholders 
for the over 400 applications we supported.</p>
				<p>My second rotation was on the Clarity Administration team. 
Clarity PPM is a project and portfolio management tool used throughout Cigna IT 
that provides visibility into current initiatives, budget and financial management,
resource management, forecasting, and time tracking.
In my role, I provided day-to-day technical and administrative support for Clarity's 5000+ users and
stakeholders. My role required strong 
communication, problem solving, and customer service skills, as well as the fine attention to detail required when working with
a production environment.
I worked with my team to redesign our ticket intake site to allow us to properly track customer requests, 
and also created custom Microsoft SQL queries for accessing real-time ticket data and statistics for the
team and management chain. Data from the ticket system indicated that during my time on the team, I handled 61% (over 1100) of our Clarity tickets.</p>
				<p>My third and final rotation was in the Cigna Information Protection (CIP) organization as an Application Support Specialist. 
My duties in CIP were split between two applications: RSA Archer and Aveksa Access Management.
Archer is an enterprise governance, risk management, and compliance (eGRC) solution. 
In my role supporting Archer, I provided administrative support and development for application owners and teams. 
I created one application from the ground up as a request form and management system to handle
requests for assistance from subject matter experts. I also worked with other teams to make modifications and enhancements to their existing Archer
applications as needed.
Aveksa Access Management is an access governance system that uses a 
role-based access control (RBAC) structure that allows for granular control and easy management
of accounts and entitlements. I developed email templates for
system-generated notifications and training documents for pilot users. 
I assisted with project activities as we prepared to roll out the new system to the whole enterprise, 
and even helped the team with the initial wave of requests after I had already transitioned to my new role in another organization.</p>
				<p>Before my graduation from the program, I was an active member of multiple TECDP committees. I began as a proofreader on 
the TECDP Proofreading team, under the Communications Committee. I later 
became the Proofreading Team Lead, where I managed incoming requests, 
assigned proofreaders, and notified stakeholders upon completion of 
their documents. I also was a member of the TECDP SharePoint 
team, under the Communications Committee, and of the Curriculum
 team, which was a project under the Development Committee.</p>
                  <p>Following my graduation from the Technology Early Career Development Program, 
                  I joined the Data Backup and Recovery team in the IT Operations organization. 
                  My day-to-day responsibilities on the team included configuration of 
                  IBM's Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) on Windows and Linux client nodes, restoration of 
                  files and Exchange mailboxes, performing health checks and basic maintenance on TSM instance servers,
                  and assisting with the team's large projects. 
                  At the time, our largest project was a migration from TSM to EMC's Avamar backup solution.
                  In addition to moving clients from TSM to Avamar, I contributed to the Avamar migration by 
                  creating a tracking document used to manage client migrations
                  and compile progress numbers and charts to be passed up the management chain.
                  On the Data Backup and Recovery team, I also led the rollout of EMC's 
                  Data Protection Advisor (DPA) solution to monitor our team's backup jobs across TSM, Avamar, Oracle RMAN, and 
                  EMC DataDomain, and created scheduled and on-demand reports for senior management.</p>
                  <p>My current role is as a Web Hosting Engineer in the Web IT organization. My team provides 24/7 support to 
                  the infrastructure that runs our major web portals, including our customer, employer, and provider portals. 
                  We create and maintain an array of scripts to make management of our 300+ Linux, AIX, and Solaris 
                  servers easier. We use a variety of tools, including our homegrown scripts, 
                  to monitor our virtual machines and collect metrics on them. I serve as the team's go-to person for all tasks 
                  related to our central metrics, monitoring, and scripting server, and 
                  for all things related to our mobile apps, which also run on our infrastructure. Typically, whenever there is 
                  a question about our metrics/monitoring server one of the mobile servers, members of the team come to me for 
                  answers. Additionally, I have worked with members of our team and other teams to move the portals and applications we 
                  support to updated machines and software. Last year we moved some of our portal services from version 6.1 to 
                  version 8.5 of WebSphere Application Server, and this year we've been moving two of our portals to WebSphere Portal Server 
                  version 8.
                  </p>
				<p>Before joining Cigna, I was a SysAdmin Student for UConn's 
Student Affairs IT (SAIT) and an Advanced Computer Technician for ResNet
 (which became a member of SAIT in 2005). I began working at the 
beginning of my second semester, in January of 2005. I progressed 
through ResNet as an Entry Level Technician, a Call Center Technician, 
and eventually an Advanced Computer Technician, where I performed 
advanced troubleshooting on student computers and wrote training 
materials for our wiki, training manual, and semesterly training 
sessions. During my final year, I was given the opportunity to work as a
 SysAdmin Student, where I imaged and added new computers to our domain 
using Norton Ghost, and tested, installed, configured, and performed 
troubleshooting on software and hardware for all SAIT staff computers.</p>
