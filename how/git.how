# Git how doc

## Summary

For now this is a place to store a reminder for local changes when switching a git master branch to main.
This should include more useful git stuff eventually.

## Switching master branch to main

Run these commands locally

```bash
git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
```
